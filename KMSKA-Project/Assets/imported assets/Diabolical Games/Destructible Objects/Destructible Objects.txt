To use the destructible object in your project, simply drag and drop the object's prefab into the scene. The object will
contain the DestructibleObject.cs script which contains variables that are modifiable through the inspector. Hover over
the variables to display a tooltip explaining the variable.

The object breaks when a collision occurs. If you would like to break the object by other means you can access the Break()
function on the DestructibleObject.cs script. If you would like to use your own custom objects, make sure to put the
DestructibleObject.cs script on the object and the Despawn.cs script on the debris prefabs.
